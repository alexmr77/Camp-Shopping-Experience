        <br>
        <p id="fontShadow" class="text-md-left text-light">
            Most camps will provide you with their packing list. Often times they are very much consistent with our suggested packing list. Some camps however have very specific items that they require or prohibit. For example, some camps require a certain number of red shorts. Additionally, other camps have restrictions on what size trunks your child’s belongings may be sent in. Our camp specialists are familiar with many of these specifications, but we recommend finding out what your camp requires or prohibits prior to coming in for your camp appointment.
